Executive summary (draft):

There are always the 3 Ps people, planet and profit that have to go hand in hand to build up something sustainable. The industry needs to be included.

There is tons of bio diversity maybe just 10% is discovered yet so there is need for research and also for including the local people there.

There is a lot of open accessible data available, how can these be combined so that 

•	Wild life detections
•	Habitat change detections
•	Identify land usage options
•	Fair marketing of local products

Combining them with available data sets / satellite images 
Near real time information  That is how we can get people involved then..

In general the over riding idea I learnt from Willie, is that we should try to give visibility to the invisible. Show using data and figures the actual results of the things, in such a measurable way that there can be no dout of the costs and benefits of certain actions.

In this way action can be taken and arguments formulated to present to local government, consumers and people on the ground.

In one of his final slides Willie summarizes 4 options (his words):

### 1) Wildlife detectives 
- idenfify animals and considitions that make them vulnerable
    
- Integrate information for various databases
	- Road construction
	- Change detection
	- Fire prediction - (fire season go to the rivers and meet humans)
	- analyse weather from online cameras

- Track ownership

	- Show the connection between Western companies the Palm oil companies
	connect the dots and create transparency

Facial recognition of animals images appearing for sales on the internet
Is it connected to some things that are happening on the ground, such as deforestation

   
### 2) Habitat change detection 
- real time detection by satelite etc) so that action can be taken on the ground
Deforestation and the loss of biodiversity.
- at speed because believe Modern systems regu
- knowledge of 
dbs that can give a value to what we still have in natural forests that can be used in a sustainable way
add a value to ethics

Need to keep diversity, how can we should that?

Deforestaion is causing loss of - 12cm 200 tons co2, per hectare per year
When peat lands burn carbon spread all over the earth and deposited over the ice-caps

- Radar photos
	- Sentinal satelite takes photos overhead every 3 days

Willie asks:
***"Can we make use of those satelite images, but go to near real time monitoring before it becomes profitable, we can already take an action locally?"

##### Identification of New roads being built:
	- wood thieves
	- trackers on trucks 
	- who's bringing products where
	- what areas are most in danger
	- how to bring that that info to the public
  
  
### 3) Identifying land use options

Recipes for land usage

- Looking at adaptation principles and planning for specific physical conditions from large scale to small practical land units
- Development of practical management models by integrating GIS and 'recipes' fro methos of land utilization
- Predict what actions on one unit of land will do to another unit of land, and then we need to show how this will affect bio-diversity and people, and the investors
     
Recipe of inputs, location, Geography, soil types, slopes, climate etc, and output a recipe and a business plan
     
### 4) Fair marketing of local products 

- Show the direct connection of International companies to the Palm oil producers. Can we show who owns what, and who profits from which.
      
Near real time information and databases that are available, and with live photos from space.

What are the strength of Blockchain technologies and how can they be applied to these areas?

  - Transparency
  - Connect people, by showing them how their donation is being used. What are direct measurable effects, and how can they be communicated clearly and effectively?
  - Shared ownership
  - Funding
  - What else?
 
 
### 5) CO2 compenation plans

CO2 compenation plans. Willie is about to start planting grasslands in North Sulawesi. An app to allow people to participate. 
Show people their tree, how many animals live in it? how much food does it provide. Money?

Could the tree be an NFT? Could they keep an eye on their tree using a [Gigapixel camera](http://360gigapixels.com/tokyo-tower-panorama-photo/).


 ### Other notes and ideas:
 
 Profit planet and people
		
why where how, how much, look integrateddHow to connect various systems and databases. Connect Aliance database to Geo database.
