Executive summary (draft):

There are always the 3 Ps people, planet and profit that have to go hand in hand to build up something sustainable. The industry needs to be included.

There is tons of bio diversity maybe just 10% is discovered yet so there is need for research and also for including the local people there.

There is a lot of open accessible data available, how can these be combined so that 

•	Wild life detections
•	Habitat change detections
•	Identify land usage options
•	Fair marketing of local products

Combining them with available data sets / satellite images 
Near real time information  That is how we can get people involved then..
