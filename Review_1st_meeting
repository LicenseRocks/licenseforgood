Goal meeting each other and exchanging on first thoughts.
We agreed on that the social badge idea is powerful because it is really broad.
Alex mentioned badges should be considered as something that does already exist and that people understand as a general is having 5 stars.

Jean showed how the social badge idea could be valuable for Ponters (a gamification way to advoid plastic wrapping in supermarkets)
Also he mentioned that he this 70-80% of the volunteers at his NGOs has a social recognition motivation for participating.
We agreed that social recognition is maybe the wrong term though as what we want is inclusiveness, awareness and to mobilize people to make an impact.

www.quorumcontrol.com asked us if we want to work with them as Ben their CTO and Kevin (BerChain) are both their and love the use case plus have social entrepreneurship backgrounds.
James will organize a Telco with them getting the developers on that call (James, Carlos and Artur). They support Javascript and Artur got already to try their solution.

Then we talked about that we should come up with ideas for the Hackathon.
We show the broad vision and try to onboard there as many NGOs as possible for the social badge idea but will work on a use case for the Masareng foundation.

Willi stated often data commons and also the locals and how they could be included.
As Ocean is there as well our use case could be something that offers locals to do some kind of data work.
On the other side we mentioned maybe we focus on the people that are not on Borneo but could support the project through work they do from here or donations they give and apply the social badge Ideas for them.

James wanted some physical object as a link to the digital badge as a sticker or QR code.
Then we discussed options we could have coming from shops offering discounts for people that were socially enganged in certain social projects.

Also we stated maybe we can come up with ways how we could engage corporates (The profit of the 3 Ps aka Planet, People and Profit)
Like that we could get them to do more pro bono work and get them to fund interesting projects.
Maybe this could also be an alternative to the green washing CSR means of corporates.
