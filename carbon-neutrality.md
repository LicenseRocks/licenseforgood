## Australia as an example:

> To achieve carbon neutral certification, entities must measure emissions, reduce these where possible, offset remaining emissions and publically report on their carbon neutrality.
> Certification for organisations, products & services, events and precincts can be sought through the Australian Governmentâ€™s Department of the Environment and Energy.
> Certification for buildings can be sought through the NABERS National Administrator or the Green Building Council of Australia
> Certification allows for the use of the certification trade mark, which can be used to showcase carbon neutral status and climate leadership.
