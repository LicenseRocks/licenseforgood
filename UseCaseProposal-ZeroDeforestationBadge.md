# Zero deforestation badge

> Soy, palm oil, beef, wood and paper products, and cocoa. The production of these goods was responsible for the loss of more than a hundred million hectares of forest between 2000 and 2012. Against this backdrop, the food and agricultural sector has largely recognized its responsibility to protect forests. Indeed, more than **470 companies** operating in the sector have **pledged to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains by 2020** â€“ and this number continues to grow.

Is thee anyone looking at Supply chains at the hackathon? Could we partner with someone and offer a solution to sustainable Palm oil / soy / beef producers?

Can we financially incentivise companies to sign on and be open and transparent?

Questions:

- How do these different companies manage their supply chains? 

- What is their measure of success, and how would that be tracked?
