# Tokenizing voluntary work 

I want to propose a building platform on which NGOs can produce non-fungible tokens so supporters can buy them. Each NFT represents an operation that can be performed by NGO, NGO volunteer, local people or third party companies. 

Example of tokens:
- Plant a tree 
- Deliver food for animals 
- Clean up place 
- Transport for volunteers 
- Accommodation for volunteers 
- Documenting NGO operations 

The token can be linked with NGO only or with NGO and volunteer/local company. In the first scenario, 100% of the money paid for NFT goes to NGO. If a volunteer or local person has a mobile phone and access to the internet, we can link NFT with a specific person that can do the work on-site. In such scenario, a person can receive 50% or more for doing his job. 

Sold NFTs can be a part of publicly available social badges. NGO can show off all sold NFTs, volunteers/local people/local companies can display NFTs to which they are connected (proof that they are doing a great job and it is worth to support them)  and lastly supporter can have all of his NFTs (that he bought) under the social badge and exchange it with others.

### Why?
- Supporters can directly support stuff that matters to them. Collecting NFTs might look like some game in which we are collecting voluntary activities just like kids did in primary schools (Pokemon, baseball cards). 
- Volunteers and local people that are working on-site can be rewarded with real money that is paid by supporters for certain NFTs.
- Supporter and volunteer can connect to each other using a platform.
- NGO can demonstrate that their work is successful by showing a list of acquired NFTs. 
- Companies that are harming environment can purchase some NFTs and share list of their tokens online. 

### What? 
- A platform on which NGO can create and sell NFT tokens (set price, describe a type of work, assign a local person or volunteer)  to supporters. 
- Widget/website on which everyone can see a social badge for NGO, volunteers, and supporters. 

### Who? 
- NGO
- Volunteers that are working on-site in various places 
- Local people / local companies that can support NGO operations  
- Companies that want to support NGO in a transparent way 

### How? 
- Smart contract for creating and selling NFTs 
- Web application that allows managing the process. 
- Web page that shows social badge and list of NFTs
