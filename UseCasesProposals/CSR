Brief description: 

Get corporates to fund more social projects and create awareness for smaller trusted projects and offer on the other hand new CSR options for corporates.

Actors:
NGOs, Corporates, maybe later Volunteers

Current state:
There are companies that like to support various social causes but need to figure out who they can donate the money to. Also there are no really nice means how they can proof their distribution.

Target state:
Social impact needs funding that could be done via offering curated social projects. 

Rough sequence:

1) Find NGOs that love the idea and get listed
2) Look for corporates that love to invest in social causes
3) Match making for both but over the app so that tokens can be generated by the receiving NGO 
4) Publish the social badge on the website
5) Visualize social impact


Effort/Complexity: medium
Impact/Adoption: high

Requirements:

Easy interface to add NGOs
Easy way to add corporates
Enable matchmaking
Offer generating tokens for the receiving NGO
Show how a social badge can collect the tokens
Show how that that social badge can be implemented in the corporate website
Show a way how the social impact due to the donation is visualized
