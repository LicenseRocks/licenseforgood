Brief description: 

Make voluntary work sexy again. With adding new technology and a way to show off social actions and its impact. We believe that one of the main motivation factors for doing voluntary work is social recognition. There is no digital proof yet.


Actors:
NGOs, Volunteers

Current state:
Often social volunteering is something people do but no one knows. Millenniums and also the generation Z are totally into doing something with a purpose and make something with a social impact. They grew up in a digital world and expect results to be fast there / almost in real time.

Target state:
Social volunteering is an important way for NGOs to have a social impact. Each volunteer should be capable of showing others what he has done if he/she wants to do so and if it might necessary.

Rough sequence:

1)Find NGOs that love the idea
2)Come up with a rough version how it could work / needs to be simple for volunteers and for users alike
3)Show how an NGO can list active contributors on their web site
4)Show how a social badge can collect numerous volunteering activities
5)Show how that that social badge van be implemented at other social media channels as instagram, Linkedin, Twitter, etc.
6) Show a global ranking of contributors (Overall / per time period)


Effort/Complexity: medium
Impact/Adoption: high

Requirements:

Easy interface to offer social work
Easy way to find social projects that offer one of the 17 SDGs that the project fights against 
Easy ways to set up everything considering 
Easy set up for sending badges to contributors
Come up with a process to transfer that earned badge to the contributor
