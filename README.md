# License for good

This planed project consists out of three different parts.

The first part is something we call **social badge**. A social badge is a proof that someone has donated time or money (also crypto) for a good cause. We believe that one main motivation for all these great volunteers and donators worldwide is some form of social recognition. Think about a smile of the person you help, a clap on your shoulder, a mentioning of your name in a meeting or even some news article about you. So how the social badge should be the digital form of that social recognition and can be applied where ever a social cause needs besides pure fiscal donation also voluntary work. Like this donating is also more inclusive as work can be contributed instead of the probably scarce source of capital.   

The second part should be a **development of a license options for creators** that considers the effort of the maintainer & sponsors some social impact activity. 

The third and last part is then to implement **a license solution based on decentralized technologies** that supports the monetization of digital assets and automates the sponsoring of projects with a social cause.

The idea is to learn, share, collaborate and support something good.

We want to be inclusive to any actors and technologies.
We want to empower any creators to make the world a bit better by supporting social impact activities while generating income.
We believe that blockchain can help to stop brain drain and build up developing countries. Only internet and a computer are needed to give people access to learn and start contributing to global projects. With blockchain we can now start transferring the generated value that is split in a very unfair way as for now.

Any creator of any digital asset using any of these license solutions published under the **License for Good** license accepts that a selectable part of the income will be donated to a previous selectable sustainable project.

Some part of the income will be used to develop further the license framework and gets distributed to the maintainers of the project. Before you start screaming, our experience is that if we don't set it up like this then it is really likely that the project won't be maintained in a sustainable way. If you don't like it, well is open source feel free to fork and do ya own thing. Everything is transparent and this is our thesis that we need this for maintainers if that is not the case we are happy to change the rules. 

A certain to be defined percentage should be used to support the maintainers and / or to develop the ecosystem further. The idea here is to keep the percentage as low as possible but build up a sustainable business out of it.

The creator or sponsor of the creator should decide on that using our interface to set up a fair **license for good** license agreement. 

A clear governance model how we select new projects in or how we decide on which project will be supported needs to be developed.

Also enterprises should be capable of sponsoring such an activity.

Any actor (creator & sponsor & buyer) should have the option to show the digital world how a provable contribution looks like. This can be done with badges that can be published in social profiles (XING; LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook,GitHub, and so on). The only thing that a lot of these great volunteers get is the kudos of anyone who knows what they do. Also after talking to several people in that space this is something they at least expect. This is the social recognition for their free voluntary work for a better world. If we have a digital approach this badge would then represent their social recognition. When clicking on it one can see then their contribution.

We like to support blockchain devs worldwide from developing countries or countries that have problems to access to the global digital economy because of any governmental restrictions, access to capital or promoting their products and services.

**Potential partners are:** 

*Developers

*NGOs

**Needed roles:**

*Maintainers  
*Creators  
*Sponsors  
*Buyers  
*Promoters  

We believe that social fundraising and especially development aid is broken as donating money for food or set up projects often leads to dependence of the people we wanted to help. Projects were the local population were included and were active contributing part of overal project performed and lived way longer in our experience. 

We truly believe that a project like this can be only successful if we start collaborating within a strong set of neded and listed partners.

We also believe that to work in a sustainable way it is fine that we have somehow an incentive layer backing the whole idea and that contributors especially the maintainers should be compensated to make this a sustainable new approach for developemnt aid.

Come and join us, we plan to kick of this social movement by becoming part of a hackathon and gathering like minded people, needed partners and developing the first approach.
