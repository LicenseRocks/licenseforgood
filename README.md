# License for good

This planed project consists out of two different parts.

On the one hand we want to develop a license options for creators that considers the effort of the maintainer &amp; sponsors some social impact activity, on the hand we want to provide a license solution based on decentralized technologies that supports the monetization of digital assets. 

The idea is to learn, share, collaborate and suport something good.

We want to be inclusive to any actors and technologies.
We want to empower any creators to make the world a bit better by supporting social impact activities while generating income.
We believe that Blockchain can help to stop brain drain and build up developing countries. Only internet, a computer are needed to give people access to learn and start contributing to global projects. With blockchain we can now start transfering the generated value that is split in a very unfair way as for now.    

Any creator of any digital asset using any of these license solutions published under the License for Good license accepts that a selectable part of the income will be donated to a previous selectable sustainable project.

10% of the income will be used to develop further the license framework and gets distributed to the maintainers of the project. Before you start screaming, our experience is that if we don't set it up like this then it is really likely that the project won't be maintained in a sustainable way. If you don't like it, well is open source feel free to fork and do ya own thing. Everything is transparent and this is our thesis that we need this for maintainers if that is not the case we are happy to change the rules.

At least 10% and up to 90 % of the income needs to be spend for a good cause. The creator or sponsor of the creator should decide on that. 

Also enterprises should be capable of sponsoring such an activity. 

Any actor (creator & sponsor & buyer) should have the option to show the digital world how a provable constribution looks like. This can be done with patches.  

We like to support  Blockchain devs worldwide from developing countries or countries that have problems to access to the global digital economy because of any govermental restrictions.

In the beginning we like to build up a female focused blockchain developing community in Iran.
