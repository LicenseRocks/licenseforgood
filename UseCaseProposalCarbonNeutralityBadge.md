# Carbon neutral badge in co-operation with Masarang


I would like to propse we do a carbon Neutral badge with the [Masarang Reforestry Project](https://masarang.nl/en/what-we-do/reforestation/)


Start with....

### Why?

The aim would be to drive visibility and funding to Masarang foundation by way of companies that want to be able to show an exact-ish verifiable Carbon Neutrality score for them or their customers.

Individuals will similarly be able to determine and show their own personal verifiable Carbon Neutral score.


### What?

The badge is is visual representation of how Carbon Neutral the Company / Organisation / Indivual is. I'm imagining opacity, size, shape, colour or ??? showing how Neutral they are.

The badge could be published on website (locked down by ip address and/or other means so it can't be put elsewhere). The generation of the image is dynamic and is a visual representation of how carbon neutral the company is. And all the other places we discussed.

The construction of a badge is built by live-ish data (or more likely data models / general estimations) coming from the Masarang Foundation. 

The calculation would be something like:

``` Estimated Calculated Carbon Produced - (square metres of planted forest sponsored * ratio of maturity)   ```


### Who?

- Companies - the biggest potential flow of money
- Individuals - can show their own personal carbon neutral badge
- Organisations - Schools, ?, ?, ...


Other partners:

- [Amadeus](https://amadeus.com/en)
- All online portals like Travel Fusion, Trip advisor etc
- Governments - eg - see Australian government below, and other International certification bodies


### How?

As above. Also to say that the economics would need to be thought out some how in terms of how much offsetters can contribute and what they will get for it. It could get very interesting if there is an over subscription as there is fixed supply. Or do we make it so that the land is infinitely divisable, and the value of the land itself increases as more and more people contribute. The value of the land actually increases as more people invest. This is beginning to remind me of what Team Morpheus is working on from the call today.

Any increased value flows down to the people on the ground somehow would be AMAZE-BALLS

#### Why do and would companies do this?

The benefits of carbon neutral certification
Carbon neutral certification can result in a range of benefits for organisations and businesses taking the lead in moving towards a low carbon economy.

- Increased customer recognition
- A new competitive edge
- Enhanced corporate social responsibility
- Positive social and environmental outcomes
- Improved employee engagement and community connection
- Energy and cost savings
- Networking opportunities with other certified entities.

## Australia as an example:

> To achieve carbon neutral certification, entities must measure emissions, reduce these where possible, offset remaining emissions and publically report on their carbon neutrality.
> Certification for organisations, products & services, events and precincts can be sought through the Australian Governmentâ€™s Department of the Environment and Energy.
> Certification for buildings can be sought through the [NABERS National Administrator](https://nabers.gov.au/) or the [Green Building Council of Australia](http://new.gbca.org.au/)
> Certification allows for the use of the certification trade mark, which can be used to showcase carbon neutral status and climate leadership.
