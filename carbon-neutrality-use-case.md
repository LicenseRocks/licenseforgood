# Carbon neutral badge in co-operation with Masarang

I would like to propse we do a carbon Neutral badge with the [Masarang Reforestry Project](https://masarang.nl/en/what-we-do/reforestation/)

The badge is is visual representation of how Carbon Neutral the Company / Organisation / Indivual is. I'm imagining opacity, size, shape, colour or ??? showing how Neutral they are.

The badge could be published on website (locked down by ip address and/or other means so it can't be put elsewhere). The generation of the image is dynamic and is a visual representation of how carbon neutral the company is. And all the other places we discussed.

The construction of a badge is built by live-ish data (or more likely data models / general estimations) coming from the Masarang Foundation. 

The calculation would be something like:

``` Estimated Calculated Carbon Produced - (square metres of planted forest sponsored * ratio of maturity)   ```


Other partners:

- [Amadeus](https://amadeus.com/en)
- All online portals like Travel Fusion, Trip advisor etc
- Governments - eg - see Australian government below.

The benefits of carbon neutral certification
Carbon neutral certification can result in a range of benefits for organisations and businesses taking the lead in moving towards a low carbon economy.

- Increased customer recognition
- A new competitive edge
- Enhanced corporate social responsibility
- Positive social and environmental outcomes
- Improved employee engagement and community connection
- Energy and cost savings
- Networking opportunities with other certified entities.

## Australia as an example:

> To achieve carbon neutral certification, entities must measure emissions, reduce these where possible, offset remaining emissions and publically report on their carbon neutrality.
> Certification for organisations, products & services, events and precincts can be sought through the Australian Governmentâ€™s Department of the Environment and Energy.
> Certification for buildings can be sought through the [NABERS National Administrator](https://nabers.gov.au/) or the [Green Building Council of Australia](http://new.gbca.org.au/)
> Certification allows for the use of the certification trade mark, which can be used to showcase carbon neutral status and climate leadership.
